# Large Scale Language Model for Text Classification

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a text classification model using a large scale language model, specifically fine-tuning a BERT model for multi-class classification. We are working with a text dataset from various newsgroups, aiming to classify each document into one of the given categories.

## Data Exploration
We started the project by exploring the dataset. This involved analyzing the structure of the data, the distribution of categories, and the text content of each category. 

### Key Findings:
- Initial exploration revealed the data to be quite messy with inconsistent document lengths.
- We found some domain-specific content, especially in the 'comp' category.
- The dataset is unbalanced, with some categories having more documents than others.
- The text content varies significantly across categories.

(We will continue to add more findings here as we further explore the data.)

## Data Preprocessing
(To be updated as we process the data)

## Model Selection and Training
(To be updated as we train the model)

## Model Evaluation
(To be updated as we evaluate the model)

## Project Conclusion
(To be updated once the project concludes)
